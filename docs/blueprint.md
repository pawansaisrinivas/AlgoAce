# **App Name**: AlgoAce

## Core Features:

- Code Generation: Code Generation: Generates DSA code solutions based on problem descriptions using a Large Language Model. The LLM can incorporate tools when the output code may conditionally use extra info from constraints and examples to make the solutions fully functional and exactly correct based on hidden testcases.
- Problem Input: Problem Input: Accepts problem descriptions, constraints, and example inputs/outputs via a text editor.
- Code Display: Code Display: Displays the generated code in a formatted, read-only editor with syntax highlighting.
- Theme Switching: Theme Switching: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- Language Selection: Language Selection: Allows users to select the output code language (e.g., Python, Java, C++).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#2962FF), evokes trust, intelligence, and efficiency.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F7FA), offers a clean and distraction-free coding environment.
- Accent color: Vibrant purple (#A214FF), highlights key UI elements and actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for both body and headline text, due to its clean and modern design that provides excellent readability.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' monospace font for code snippets, for clear differentiation and readability.
- Minimalist and clear icons for common actions (e.g., generate, copy, theme toggle).
- Split-screen layout with adjustable panels for problem input and code display.
